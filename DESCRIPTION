Description: Provides shiny modules that used to visualize and interact with
    gene set enrichment analyses performed by the sparrow package. A
    self-contained shiny application is also included that can be launched
    over a SparrowResult to explore it live during your analsyes. The app can
    also be deployed to a shiny server, where you can upload a SparrowResult
    object to it for external exploration. Currently the methods here are very
    closely tied to the outputs generated by the sparrow package, and are likely
    not re-usable for other purposes.
